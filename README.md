## About Me

I'm passionate about coding and problem-solving. Currently, I'm diving into Python and web development with Django.

With a creative background, I love blending logic and design, and I'm always looking for new challenges to grow my skills. I aim to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers to learn and improve.
